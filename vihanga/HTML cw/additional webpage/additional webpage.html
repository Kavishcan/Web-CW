        <h3> Jellyfish Lake </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The millions of golden jellyfish found in Jellyfish Lake are a unique subspecies, Mastigias papua etpisoni, named after former President Ngiratkel Etpison. This subspecies is found only in this marine lake, and nowhere else in the world.

            Jellyfish Lake is one of the isolated, stratified (meromictic) marine lakes. The lakeâ€™s edge is lined with mangrove trees and their roots are covered with a colorful assortment of marine invertebrates. Jellyfish Lake is 400 m long and 30 m deep. Between 13-15 m, there is a pink layer of bacteria and below that, there is no light and no oxygen. The bottom water layer is filled with poisonous dissolved hydrogen sulfide gas. The lake has numerous indirect connections to the lagoon and the tidal rise and fall is delayed by two hours (compared to the lagoon). The tidal range is 45% of that in the lagoon (2 m), or about 0.8 m.

        <h3>Age of the Lake </h3>
        
        <p>
            Jellyfish Lake is around 12,000 years old. This age estimate is based on the depth of the lake (about 30 meters), an estimate of the thickness of the sediment (at least 20 meters[4]) and the rising sea level since the end of the last ice age. About 12,000 years ago, the sea level had risen to the point that sea water began to fill the Jellyfish Lake basin.
